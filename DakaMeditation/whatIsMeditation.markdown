## What is meditation?

 Meditation is a practice that has been used for centuries to train the mind and achieve a mentally 
 clear and emotionally calm state. It often involves focusing the mind on a particular object, thought, 
 or activity, such as breathing, to help achieve a state of relaxation and concentration. There are 
 many different forms of meditation, including mindfulness meditation, loving-kindness meditation, and 
 transcendental meditation, among others. Meditation can be practiced by people of all ages and backgrounds, 
 and it has been shown to have a number of potential health benefits, including reducing stress, 
 improving focus and concentration, and increasing feelings of well-being.
