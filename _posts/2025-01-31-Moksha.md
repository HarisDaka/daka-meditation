Atman (The Individual Self)
Atman refers to the individual soul or self. It is the essence of who you are, 
beyond the physical body and the mind. Atman is eternal, pure, and unchanging. 
It is the spark of divine consciousness residing within each being.

â€¢ Nature of Atman: Atman is not limited by time or space; it is ever-present and connected to the universe. 
While your physical form may change, the Atman remains constant.

â€¢ Realization: The journey to realize Atman is a journey inward. Through meditation, self-inquiry, 
and spiritual practices, one learns to distinguish the true self from the illusions of the mind and the ego.

Brahman (The Universal Consciousness)
Brahman represents the ultimate reality, the universal consciousness that pervades everything. 
It is formless, infinite, and the source of all creation. Unlike Atman, which pertains to the individual, 
Brahman encompasses all that exists.

â€¢ Nature of Brahman: Brahman is described in various ways: as Sat (truth), Chit (consciousness), and Ananda (bliss). 
It is the ground of being from which all aspects of existence emerge and to which they eventually return.

â€¢ Unity: Brahman is the underlying reality behind all phenomena. 
Though the physical world may appear diverse and separate, it is all an 
expression of this singular consciousness.

The Relationship Between Atman and Brahman
The profound realization in the spiritual journey is that Atman and Brahman are ultimately one. 
While Atman represents your individual existence, Brahman embodies the universal nature of all things.

â€¢ Non-Dualism: In the teachings of non-dualism (Advaita), it is understood that the perceivable separateness 
is an illusion (Maya). The true essence is the oneness of Atman and Brahman, 
where the individual self merges into the universal whole.

â€¢ Self-Realization: When one realizes the oneness with Brahman, the illusion of separateness falls away, 
leading to liberation (Moksha). This is the ultimate goal of spiritual seekers: to awaken to the fact 
that they are not just the Atman, but the very manifestation of Brahman itself.
