<meta name="description" content="The truth of suffering (dukkha): Life is inherently full of suffering and dissatisfaction. Not only the obvious forms of suffering - such as pain, loss and grief - but also the more subtle forms, such as the fleeting nature of happiness and the discomfort caused by unfulfilled desires. Recognizing this reality is the first step in understanding the nature of existence. The truth of the cause of suffering (samudaya): The root of suffering lies in desire and attachment (tanha). We often cling to desires, identities and impermanent experiences, seeking lasting satisfaction in the impermanent. This attachment leads to cycles of birth and rebirth and causes further suffering. The truth of the end of suffering (nirodha): It is possible to end suffering. By letting go of desire and attachment, one can attain a state of peace and liberation known as nirvana. This means removing the causes of suffering and realizing one’s true nature. The Truth of the Path to the End of Suffering (Magga): The path that leads to the cessation of suffering is the Noble Eightfold Path, which consists of: Right Understanding Right Intention Right Speech Right Action Right Livelihood Right Effort Right Mindfulness Right Concentration" />
