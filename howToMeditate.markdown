Meditation is a practice that can help you train your mind to focus and redirect your thoughts. Here's a simple way to get started with meditation:
1. Find a quiet and comfortable place. Sit in a chair or on the floor with your head, neck and back straight but not stiff.
2. Try to set aside all thoughts of the past and the future and stay in the present.
3. Become aware of your breath, focusing on the sensation of air moving in and out of your body as you breathe. 
       Feel your belly rise and fall, and the air enter your nostrils and leave your mouth. Pay attention to the way each breath changes and        is different.
4. Watch every thought come and go, whether it be a worry, fear, anxiety or hope. When thoughts come up 
       in your mind, don't ignore or suppress them but simply note them, remain calm and use your breathing as an anchor.
5. If you find yourself getting carried away in your thoughts, observe where your mind went off to, without judging, 
       and simply return to your breathing. Remember not to be hard on yourself if this happens.
6. As the time comes to a close, sit for a minute or two, becoming aware of where you are. Get up gradually.
       You can start with just a few minutes a day, and then increase the time as you get more comfortable with 
       the practice. There are also many apps and guided meditations available that can help you if you find it 
       difficult to meditate on your own.
